## Hi there, I'm Tyrecee
Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a Computer Science student currently pursuing my degree with a major in Machine Learning and Data Science, with my goal being to eventually work as a (Full Stack) Machine Learning Engineer, Data Scientist or Software Engineer, preferably working with Large Language Models and/or Computer Vision. 

### My Academic Journey
I'm currently entering my second year of university, learning and applying programming concepts.
##### My Current Skills:
- Discrete Mathematics, Statisitcs and Mulitvariable Calculus
- Information Systems and Relational Databases (SQL, PostgresSQL)
- Backend Programming Fundamentals and OOP (Python, Java)
##### Skills I am looking foward to Learning:
- Large Langugage Models and Neural Networks
- Advanced Machine Learning and Statistical Learning
- Advanced Techniques for High Dimensional Data and Big Data

### Current Projects
I'm actively working on some exciting projects that allow me to apply what I've been learning and demonstrate my technical ability:
#### 1. (QLD) ATAR Goal Tracker Dashboard
This project focuses on utilizing historical Queensland ATAR Sources to predict student ATAR results, with a primary focus on helping students reach their desired ATAR by highlighting areas of improvement and suggesting minimum results required to meet their goal.

### My Interests
- Machine Learning and AI: Exploring algorithms and data-driven solutions to solve real-world problems.
- Data Visualization: Creatring meaningful visual representations of complex datasets.
- Social Media Data: Studying trends and behaviours on social media platforms.
- Automation: Improving time management by automating labor intensive tasks.
